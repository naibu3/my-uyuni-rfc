- Feature Name: CVE auditing with VEX
- Start Date: 2025-02-19

# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Use VEX in addition to existing implementation to increment CVE auditing accuracy.

- Why are we doing this?
- What use cases does it support?
- What is the expected outcome?

In a world constantly endangered by security flaws it is crucial to detect threats in order to secure our systems. However detection systems may detect false positives from products that use vulnerable libraries but do not use vulnerable functions. Or even not detecting produts whose vulnerabilities are not patched yet.

Due to this, many companies like Red Hat are adopting **VEX** (*Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange*) [^1]. This format allows to clasify CVEs affecting a product by the terms **Fixed**, **Known Affected**, **Known Not Affected** and **Under Investigation**. This way it is possible to improve accuracy and discard false detections.

The aim is to polish CVE auditing, simplifying administration and keeping Uyuni up to date with the market standards.

# Detailed design

The implementation for VEX will follow a similar structure as existing OVAL one [^2]. Here is a diagram to ilustrate the modules structure:

TODO - Create diagram

Mainly we will have two main objectives: **VEX data storaging/processing** and **CVE analysis**.

## VEX Data Storage and Processing

### VEX Downloader

### VEX Parser (VEX DTO)

### VEX DAO

### DB Storage

## CVE enhanced analysis

## API Access

# Drawbacks

Why should we **not** do this?

  * will it impact performance?

# Alternatives

# Unresolved questions

- Is it possible to use same database tables as OVAL uses? [^2]
- Should be taken into consideration data from the legacy system (OVAL) if VEX is available?
